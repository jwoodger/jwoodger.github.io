I am a passionate and dedicated software developer from Toronto, Canada. I&#39;m
constantly seeking out information and news on new technologies and even though
I&#39;m finished school, I aim to keep learning new things every day.</p>
<p>
From 2017 to 2022 I was a student at the University of Toronto where I graduated
with my B.Sc in computer science. While at the university, I was a part of the
co-op program and got valuable job experience. Besides my CS major, I also
minored in statistics and media studies.</p>
<p>
With software development, my specific areas of expertise include programming in
C# and Java, as well as database management and unit testing. I also have
experience with web frameworks such as Spring (including Spring Boot) and
ASP.NET.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, I can speak French fluently after having taken classes all through
elementary and high school, and can work well in a bilingual environment.</p>
<p>
As someone who minored in the humanities, I understand the importance of
communicating your ideas to others, especially when you are all part of a team
working towards a shared goal. That&#39;s why I always take care to write code that
not only works, but is readable and well-documented so that others can
understand it.</p>
<p>
Outside of work I have many interests. I play the piano and the trumpet, and
love to listen to music in a variety of genres (my current favourite artists are
Pink Floyd, Talking Heads, and King Crimson). I also enjoy reading, watching
movies, and taking walks around the city (weather permitting, of course!).</p>
<p>
