      <description>I am a passionate and dedicated software developer from Toronto, Canada. I&amp;#39;m constantly seeking out information and news on new technologies and even though I&amp;#39;m finished school, I aim to keep learning new things every day.
From 2017 to 2022 I was a student at the University of Toronto where I graduated with my B.Sc in computer science. While at the university, I was a part of the co-op program and got valuable job experience.</description>
